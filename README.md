for example
you have 3 people in research group with mod researched
if 2 people join they can buy the mod for 1.5x the original price (same as standalone team) instead of 3x the original price

original research cost calculation
original_cost * (party_size * 0.5)

new research cost calculation
original_cost * (in_party_without_the_research * 0.5)
